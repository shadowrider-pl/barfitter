    "text1": "<h1 id='m1'>Introduction</h1> <p><br/> <br/>          The Barfitter system is a cloud-based application for comprehensive restaurant management. To use Barfitter you only need internet-connected devices with a web browser. In this case, you do not need to install any programs, databases, take care of necessary updates, create backups. This is done by specialized people operating servers. Barfitter users focus only on operating the restaurant and not on computers. <br/> ",
    "text2": "Recommended equipment requirements for efficient Baritter operation: <ul> <li> any computer or laptop for the Owner and Manager </li> <li> tablet or phone for the Bartender </li> <li> tablet or phone for the Cook </li> </ul> - all devices must be connected to the Internet <br/> Nothing prevents anyone working in a restaurant from having their device and an account in Barfitter. In the Barfitter application, users are divided into four groups, each of which has their tasks: <ul> <li> Owner </li> <li> Manager </li> <li> Bartender </li> <li> Cook </li> </ul> It is recommended that every user assigned to be only to one group, however, the system allows one person who e.g. has Manager and Bartender tasks to perform them from one account. <br/> ",
    "text3": "Products <br> Each product served in a restaurant has several features. <ul> <li> Product type: <ul> <li> Ready - a product that is not processed, i.e. a bottle of Pepsi, bottled beer Heineken, a pack of nuts. The number of these products can be counted during an inventory </li> <li> Made on the bar - a product made only by the bartender, e.g. a cup of espresso coffee, a glass of water with concentrated raspberry juice, tea </li> <li> Made in the kitchen - a product that is prepared by a chef, e.g. pizza, pork neck, dumplings. </li> </ul> </li> <li> Categories e.g. bottled beer, hot drinks, salads. During sales, the bartender searches for the products by going through the various categories. </li> <li> VAT rates of purchase [ready products] and sales </li> <li> Purchase prices of [ready products] and sales </li> <li> Active - whether a given product can be added for authorization < / li> </ul> <br/> <br/> <h1 id = 'm2'> Preparation of the application </h1> <br/> Before using the Barfitter application, it must be adapted to a specific restaurant. To do this, follow these steps: <ul> <li> set up users with their roles </li> <li> set up payment methods - if there are any other than Cash and Card </li> <li> specify restaurant rooms and assigned tables to them </li> <li> specify VAT rates used in the market </li> <li> set categories to which products will be assigned </li> <li> choose Favorite products - those that are sold most often - when ordering faster access to them will be possible </li> <li> select cross-selling categories </li> <li> complete the restaurant details by clicking the Restaurant button </li> </ul> <br/> <br/> <br/>",
    "text4": "<h1 id = 'm3'> Users </h1> <p> <br/> <br/> Users are set by the Owner. After clicking the Users button, fill in its data. The e-mail field is useful when the user forgets his password - he will be able to recover it himself. The last item in the form is user profiles, i.e. groups to which they will belong: <ul> <li /> ROLE_BOSS - owner <li /> ROLE_MANAGER - manager <li /> ROLE_BARMAN - bartender <li /> ROLE_CHEF - chef </ul> <br/> Ideally, each user should be assigned to only one group. Avoid situations when the user is both a bartender and a chef. If you check the Active box, the user will not be able to log in to the application. The system will usually not allow you to delete an existing user. <br/> Example 1: A new bartender is hired to start work next week. The owner creates a Barfitter account for him. The bartender, however, does not go to work. In this situation it is possible to delete his account. <br/> Example 2: A new bartender is hired to start work next week. The owner creates a Barfitter account for him. The bartender works a week and quits after this period. In this situation, it is not possible to delete his account. His login has already been assigned to the orders he has accepted. If he were removed, his orders in history would have remained without a bartender, which is why the system does not allow this. For security reasons, such a user should be marked Inactive so that he cannot log in to the restaurant. <br/> <br/> <h1> Payments </h1> <p> <br/> <br/> The manager can add new payments as needed - e.g. transfer, online payment, etc. Payments that have ever been used ones can no longer be deleted, but only can be marked as inactive - then they will not appear as a payment option for bartender orders. Cash and card payments cannot be removed under any circumstances. <br/> <br/> <H1> Vat rates </h1> <br/> Vat rates are set by the <b> Owner </b>. Rates that have ever been used can no longer be deleted, but can only be marked as inactive - then they will not appear as an option when adding new products. <br/> <br/> <H1> Favorites </h1> <br/> Favorites are the products that are sold most often - faster access will be possible. They are chosen by <b> Manager </b>. <br/> <br/> <H1> Cross selling </h1> <br/> Cross selling allows the bartender to increase the value of the order. The manager must link together product categories, which are often ordered together. Example: We add <b> Cross-selling </b> from the <i> Pizza </i> category to the <i> Beer </i> category. When the bartender adds any pizza to the order, a suggestion appears on the screen to offer the customer a beer. It only works one way. There is no need to suggest pizza for every beer. However, if we want to do this, we should add new cross-selling from the <i> Beer </i> category to the <i> Pizza </i> category. <br/> <br/> <H1> Tables </h1> <br/> Barfitter allows you to assign tables to a given room. At the beginning you need to define a room: <ul> <li /> in the tables menu click Add table <li /> fill in Description - e.g. Bar room <li /> check the Active box <li /> field Select room leave empty </ul> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Adding a table to the room: <ul> <li /> in the tables menu click Add table <li /> fill in Description - e.g. Table 1, Round table, Table under the window <li /> check the Active box <li /> select the appropriate room </ul> <br/> Tables and inactive rooms will not appear when the bartender opens the order. <br/> If the restaurant is delivering or taking away, you can add a room with the name <b> Pickup </b>. <br/> <br/> <br/> <H1> Categories </h1> <br/> A category should be assigned to each product. Categories are divided into main categories and subcategories. <br/> First we define the main categories: <ul> <li /> in the Categories menu, click Add category <li /> enter the Name - e.g. Denmark, Drinks <li /> check the Active field <li /> leave the Select parent category field empty </ul> <br/> Adding a subcategory: <ul> <li /> in the Categories menu, click Add category <li /> enter a Name - e.g. Soups <li /> check the Active <li /> select the appropriate parent category e.g. Denmark </ul> <br/> Inactive categories will not appear when the bartender chooses products. <br/> <br/> <H1> Adding products </h1> <br/> Adding products in the Barfitter application takes two steps. Step 1: <b> Manager </b> adds new and delivered products. Step 2: <b> Owner </b> checks the entered products and authorizes the delivery <br/> This method allows you to check for possible errors and correctness of the data entered",
    "text5": "<H1> Stock </h1> <br/> Product management is done by clicking the <b> Stock </b> button. Products are grouped according to their types. Here, <b> Owner </b> or <b> Manager </b> can change product details. Note that <b> Manager </b> <u> cannot </u> change key product properties, i.e.: <ul> <li /> Names </li> <li /> Quantities </li> <li /> Type </li> </ul> Only <b> Owner </b> can change this. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <H1> Taking cash </h1> <br/> There should not be too much cash in the cash register, so from time to time <b> Manager </b> or <b> Owner </b> should take it. After pressing the <b> Take Cash </b> button, enter the appropriate amount. It will be included when the bartender counts the cash at the end of the day. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <H1> Replacement products </h1> <br/> When a Bartender wants to sell a product that is not on the list of available products or cannot find it by searching the categories, he sells substitute product Example: A new delivery of Bażant bottled beer has arrived. The bartender receives the order from the customer for this beer, but it has not yet been added or authorized to Barfitter and is not displayed on the list of available beers. In this situation, the Bartender sells a replacement product and writes 'Bażant beer' in the commentary. After adding and authorizing the delivery of this beer, the Manager must then authorize this product, i.e. select it from the list of available products. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> ",
    "text6": "<H1> Bartender </h1> <br/> <H2> New order </H2> <br/> The bartender's panel shows rooms. After clicking on the room, the tables assigned to it will appear. By clicking on an empty table, the process of creating a new order will start. <br/> The bartender, clicking on the categories, searches for the product chosen by the customer. Sets its quantity and can possibly change its price, e.g. when the customer has a discount card. <br/> Example 1: Customer orders tea. The bartender finds tea in the appropriate category, enters the quantity and presses the <b> Save </b> button. <br/> Example 2 A customer orders Pheasant beer and sticks. The bartender finds a beer in the appropriate category, enters the quantity and presses the <b> Add product </b> button. Pheasant appears on the list of ordered products. Then in the appropriate category, he finds the fingers, enters the quantity and presses <b> Add product </b>. If all the products selected by the customer are already on the list, he presses the <b> Save </b> button. <br/> Example 3: Customer orders tomato soup, asks not to sprinkle with dill. The bartender finds the soup in the appropriate category, enters the quantity and presses the <b> Add product </b> button. This is a product made in the kitchen, so the bartender can immediately send the order to the cook by pressing the <b> Save and send to the kitchen </b> button. However, the customer has indicated that he does not want dill, so on the order list you should find this product, press the <b> Edit </b> button and write in the comment 'without dill'. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <H2> Quick order </H2> <br/> When a customer does not want to open a new account, e.g. orders a bottle of beer, sticks and pays immediately, press the Quick order button. When browsing categories, only ready products and those prepared by the bartender - e.g. tea - will be displayed there. This order immediately goes to the order history. Do not use <b> Quick Order </b> when a customer, for example, orders a pizza and insists on paying immediately. You can then accept the payment, but you must open a normal order and write in the comment that the customer has already paid. <br/> <br/> <H2> Viewing open orders </H2> <br/> The bartender can view open orders by clicking the Orders button. They are grouped in salami. The left part of the order details are displayed: number, table, time of order opening, login of the bartender accepting the order, comment, sum of the order. By clicking the View button you can get more details about the order. By clicking the Edit button, you can change the table and enter a comment. Similarly, you can view, change the price and comment, delete ordered products. You can add another product to the order here - e.g. when the customer finally orders a dessert. To update your order list, click the Refresh button below the product list. Do not refresh the entire page in your browser, because it takes a lot more time. <br/> <br/> <H2> Closing the order and accepting payments </H2> <br/>After clicking <b> Payment </b>, a list of active forms of payment appears. Click the chosen form and the order disappears from the list of open orders and appears in the history. The order number appears in the order comment. When paying in cash, the system helps calculate the remainder to spend - e.g. the amount of the order is PLN 45, the customer has a PLN 100 banknote, after entering 100 in the cash field, the amount of PLN 65 will appear. You can also accept combined payment. For example, the order amount is PLN 45, the customer has a PLN 20 banknote and the rest he wants to pay by card. Then click <b> Combined Payment </b> and enter the appropriate amounts into the form. There are 2 orders in the history: <ol> <li /> 1. the main order with all products for PLN 20, payment in cash, with comment #123, where 123 is the order number. <li /> additional order, without any products, for the amount of PLN 25, card payment, with the comment Card-&gt; #123. </ol> <br/><br/> <H2> Sales after closing the cash register </H2> <br/> If there is a customer who wants to buy a product after closing the cash register, the sales process should be carried out normally and the cash register closed once again. <br/> <br/> <H2> Daily bartender statistics </H2> <br/> The bartender has the ability to view daily summaries of orders and products sold. The <b> Today's sales </b> button is for this. <br/> <br/> <h2> Starting a new work day </h2> At the beginning of each day, <b> Bartender </b> must click the <b> Start new day </b> button and enter the appropriate amount of cash at the cash register, after checking it out. If the amount does not match the amount entered at the end of the previous day, please enter a comment here. All orders will be assigned to that day, even after midnight. <br/> <br/> <H2> Finishing work </H2> <br/> Close the cash register at the end of the day. The bartender clicks the <b> Close cash register </b> button and enters the amount of cash in his cash register. The Barfitter system sums up the amount of cash at the start of the day, cash sale and the amount taken by the Manager or the Owner. If for some reason the amount at the end of the day does not match the amount calculated by the system, this should be described in the comment. <br/> <br/> ",
    "text7": "<h1> Chef </h1> <p> <br/> <br/> In Barfitter, the Chef's tasks are kept to a minimum. He accepts or rejects incoming orders and then marks the prepared products as Ready. Only orders with products to be processed in the kitchen are displayed in the Chef panel. <ul> <li> Red - with products acceptable. </li> <li> Blue - with products accepted </li> <li> Gray - with products ready for release </li> </ul> <br/> <br/> <H1> Notifications </h1> <br/> An important functionality of the Barfitter system are notifications sent to the Bartender and the Chef in connection with the change in the status of the ordered product. Notifications appear in the form of a bell icon with the appropriate number of products to handle and a sound signal. By clicking on the bell, <b> Chef </b> goes to the <b> Panel </b>, while <b> Bartender </b> goes to the <b> Products to be released </b> page. <br/> <b> Note: </b> Sounds are not enabled by default - this is due to the default browser sound blockade on Android. After each login, enable them by clicking the red crossed-out bell icon in the top menu. <br/> There are only 3 situations when notifications exchanged between the <b> Bartender </b> and <b> Chef: </b> <ol> <li> The bartender changes the status of the order to Sent to the kitchen. </li> <li> The chef rejects the order. A rejected product, the bartender should remove. </li> <li> The chef changes the order status to Ready. </li> </ol> <br/> Notifications are given to all logged-in Bartenders and Chefs. Remember that the person to whom the notification is sent should be logged in at the moment. If the user notices that notifications do not reach him, then in the upper menu click <b> Account &gt; Check Notifications </b>. <br/> <br/> <br/> <H1> The process of handling products made in the kitchen </h1> <br/> By accepting a new order for a product prepared in the kitchen, the Bartender begins cooperation with the Chef. This process consists of several steps: 1. Acceptance of the order by the Bartender 2. Sending the order by the Bartender to the kitchen 3. Acceptance or rejection of the order by the Chef 4. Preparation of the product by the Chef 5. Release of the order by the Bartender The Barfitter system records the times of all the above activities and gives how many minutes each step took to complete. If the step lasted more than 30 minutes, it is marked in red. <br/> Details: <ol> <li> Acceptance of the order by the Bartender. This is no different from accepting an order for a finished product. </li> <li> Sending the order by the bartender to the kitchen. On the list of ordered products, press the Send to Kitchen button. You can also, after selecting products for the new order, press the Save and send to the Kitchen. </li> <li> The chef receives notification of a new order. Clicking on the bell icon goes to the list of open orders. The Chef can accept or reject any product by clicking the appropriate icon. </li> <li> After preparing the product, the Chef clicks the Done icon. The bartender receives a notification that the product is ready for release. </li> <li> The bartender gives dishes to the customer and confirms it by clicking the Pay button. </li> </ol> <br/> <ul> <li> The bartender cannot remove from the list of products ordered that are already prepared in the kitchen. </li> <li> The bartender cannot close the order if it contains products prepared in the kitchen. </li> <li> If the payment option is not available after all products have been released, press the <b> Refresh </b> button. </li> </ul> <br/> <br/> "
